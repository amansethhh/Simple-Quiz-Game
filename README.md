ðŸš€ **Java Mini-Project: Quiz Game Application** ðŸš€  
Thrilled to share my Java-based quiz game using Swing! Featuring a personalized login, dynamic questions, lifelines (50/50, skip, extend time), real-time scoring, and a dark-themed GUI, it tests knowledge with a timed challenge. This project honed my skills in GUI design, event handling, OOP, and file I/O! ðŸ’»âœ¨
